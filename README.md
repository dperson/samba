# Samba

Samba docker container

# What is Samba?

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and
Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

# How to use this image

By default there are no shares configured, additional ones can be added.

## Hosting a Samba instance

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba -p

OR set local storage:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d dperson/samba -p

## Configuration

    sudo docker run -it --rm dperson/samba -h
    Usage: samba.sh [-opt] [command]
    Options (fields in '[]' are optional, '<>' are required):

                    <include file path> in the container, e.g. a bind mount

    The 'command' (if provided and valid) will be run instead of samba

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

 * `CHARMAP` - As above, configure character mapping
 * `GENERIC` - As above, configure a generic section option (See NOTE3 below)
 * `GLOBAL` - As above, configure a global option (See NOTE3 below)
 * `IMPORT` - As above, import a smbpassword file
 * `NMBD` - As above, enable nmbd
 * `PERMISSIONS` - As above, set file permissions on all shares
 * `RECYCLE` - As above, disable recycle bin
 * `SHARE` - As above, setup a share (See NOTE3 below)
 * `SMB` - As above, disable SMB2 minimum version
 * `TZ` - Set a timezone, IE `EST5EDT`
 * `USER` - As above, setup a user (See NOTE3 below)
 * `WIDELINKS` - As above, allow access wide symbolic links
 * `WORKGROUP` - As above, set workgroup
 * `USERID` - Set the UID for the samba server's default user (smbuser)
 * `GROUPID` - Set the GID for the samba server's default user (smbuser)
 * `INCLUDE` - As above, add a smb.conf include

**NOTE**: if you enable nmbd (via `-n` or the `NMBD` environment variable), you
will also want to expose port 137 and 138 with `-p 137:137/udp -p 138:138/udp`.

**NOTE2**: there are reports that `-n` and `NMBD` only work if you have the
container configured to use the hosts network stack.

**NOTE3**: optionally supports additional variables starting with the same name,
IE `SHARE` also will work for `SHARE2`, `SHARE3`... `SHAREx`, etc.

## Examples

Any of the commands can be run at creation with `docker run` or later with
`docker exec -it samba samba.sh` (as of version 1.3 of docker).

### Setting the Timezone

    sudo docker run -it -e TZ=EST5EDT -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba -p

### Start an instance creating users and shares:

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba -p \
                -u "example1;badpass" \
                -u "example2;badpass" \
                -s "public;/share" \
                -s "users;/srv;no;no;no;example1,example2" \
                -s "example1 private share;/example1;no;no;no;example1" \
                -s "example2 private share;/example2;no;no;no;example2"

# User Feedback

## Troubleshooting

* You get the error `Access is denied` (or similar) on the client and/or see
`change_to_user_internal: chdir_current_service() failed!` in the container
logs.

Add the `-p` option to the end of your options to the container, or set the
`PERMISSIONS` environment variable.

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d dperson/samba -p

If changing the permissions of your files is not possible in your setup you
can instead set the environment variables `USERID` and `GROUPID` to the
values of the owner of your files.

* High memory usage by samba. Multiple people have reported high memory usage
that's never freed by the samba processes. Recommended work around below:

Add the `-m 512m` option to docker run command, or `mem_limit:` in
docker_compose.yml files, IE:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -m 512m -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d dperson/samba -p

* Attempting to connect with the `smbclient` commandline tool. By default samba
still tries to use SMB1, which is deprecated and has security issues. This
container defaults to SMB2, which for no discernible reason even though its
support is disabled by default. So run the command as `smbclient -m SMB3`, then
any other options you would specify.
