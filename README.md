# Samba

Samba docker container

# What is Samba?

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and
Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

# How to use this image

By default there are no shares configured, additional ones can be added.

## Hosting a Samba instance

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba

OR set local storage:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d dperson/samba

## Configuration

    sudo docker run -it --rm dperson/samba -h
    Usage: samba.sh [-opt] [command]

                    <name> is how it's called for clients
                    <path> path to share

        -w "<workgroup>"       Configure the workgroup (domain) samba should use
                    required arg: "<workgroup>"
                    <workgroup> for samba

    The 'command' (if provided and valid) will be run instead of samba

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (only available with `docker run`)

 * `CHARMAP` - As above, configure character mapping
 * `NMBD` - As above, enable nmbd
 * `TZ` - As above, set a zoneinfo timezone, IE `EST5EDT`
 * `WORKGROUP` - As above, set workgroup
 * `USERID` - Set the UID for the samba server
 * `GROUPID` - Set the GID for the samba server

**NOTE**: if you enable nmbd (via `-n` or the `NMBD` environment variable), you
will also want to expose port 137 and 138 with `-p 137:137/udp -p 138:138/udp`.

## Examples

Any of the commands can be run at creation with `docker run` or later with
`docker exec -it samba.sh` (as of version 1.3 of docker).

### Setting the Timezone

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba -t EST5EDT

OR using `environment variables`

    sudo docker run -it -e TZ=EST5EDT -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba

Will get you the same settings as

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba
    sudo docker exec -it samba samba.sh -t EST5EDT ls -AlF /etc/localtime
    sudo docker restart samba

### Start an instance creating users and shares:

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba \
                -u "example1;badpass" \
                -u "example2;badpass" \
                -s "public;/share" \
                -s "users;/srv;no;no;no;example1,example2" \
                -s "example1 private;/example1;no;no;no;example1" \
                -s "example2 private;/example2;no;no;no;example2"
