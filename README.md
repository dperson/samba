# Samba

Samba docker container

# What is Samba?

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and
Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

# How to use this image

By default there are no shares configured, additional ones can be added.

## Hosting a Samba instance

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d dperson/samba

OR set local storage:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d dperson/samba
